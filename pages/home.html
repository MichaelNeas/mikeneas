		<h4>I grew up in a small town on the shoreline of Connecticut known as Old Saybrook.</h4>
		<hr>

		<hr>
		<h4>My sister was and still is one of my best friends, we used to play wiffle ball in our back yard every summer day until the sun went away.
				Together we never shy away from a challenge, and continue to push each other even today! </h4>

		<h4>After playing a ton of different sports, graduating, and meeting some of the best friends of my life I shipped out to Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  
				The regimented lifestyle was different but I learned invaluable life lessons, sailed around South America, and played collegiate lacrosse.  
				Nevertheless, I ended up transferring back to CT to go to UConn.</h4>

		<hr>
		<h4>I applied 3 times to UConn and 3 times once I was in UConn to the CSE program.  
				Once the battle of getting into the School of Engineering succeeded from me grinding out rigirous academic pre-reqs my friends and I won UConn Senior design with Hydra and successfully graduated college with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. </h4>

		<h4>Shortly after that I moved down to RTP in North Carolina where I met some really awesome people, explored the blue mountains, and the ever familiar east coast shoreline.  
				The water is a lot nicer in the Atlantic than up in the shoreline and the stars seemed brighter.</h4>

		<h4>A lot of weird nondeterministic events occured for me to end up where I am today, but I couldn't be happier. 
				I'm currently back up in New England working in Providence.</h4>

		<h4>Life is always busy, but I know where home is, and I look forward to every day.</h4>
