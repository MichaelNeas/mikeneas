		<h4>After playing a ton of different sports, graduating, and meeting some of the best friends of my life, I shipped out to Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  
				The regimented lifestyle was different but I learned invaluable life lessons, sailed around South America, and played collegiate lacrosse.  
				Nevertheless, I ended up transferring back to CT to go to UConn.</h4>

		<h4>I applied 3 times to get into UConn Storrs and then another 3 times to the Computer Science &amp; Engineering program.
			After grinding out rigirous academic pre-reqs, the battle of actually getting into the School of Engineering seceded.  
			Fast forward countless trials and tribulations.. My closest friends and I ended up winning UConn Senior design with Hydra (an unfunded, muscle controlled ,3D printed prosthetic arm)
			and I successfully graduated college with a degree in Computer Science and Engineering. </h4>

		<h4>Shortly after graduating I moved down to RTP in North Carolina. There I met some incredible people, explored the blue mountains, and the ever familiar East coast shoreline.  
				The Atlantic ocean water is a lot nicer than The Sound I was familiar with, the stars seemed brighter too.</h4>
