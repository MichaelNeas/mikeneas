		<h4>In high school I was regularly involved sports and always kept myself busy working various jobs.<br>
			My favorite teachers introduced me to Chipmunk Basic, web programming, and a variety of Engineering disciplines.<br>
			I saved up all my money to buy the 2009 15" Macbook Pro and kissed my Compaq Computer goodbye.<br>
			I graduated and shipped out to Massachusetts Maritime Academy, sailed around South America, and played collegiate lacrosse.<br>

			I took life lessons from the regimented lifestyle, paired them with my desire to become more dedicated to computers, and transferred to The University of Connecticut.

		<h4>
			Through relentless persistence, hard work, and desire to improve, I qualified for the Computer Science &amp; Engineering program, set to graduate in 2016.

		<h4>
			Countless trials and tribulations later,
			my closest friends and I took gold in UCONN's Senior Design with an unfunded, muscle &amp; android controlled, 3D printed prosthetic arm, named Hydra.<br>
			I successfully graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and Engineering.

		<h4>
			That winter, I migrated back to New England and continued my passion for Software Engineering.<br>
			I worked for a much larger company and found myself context switching between different Node.JS, Python, and PHP projects.

		<h4>
			A new oportunity induced and my IoT hobbies became my primary focus!<br>
			Here I became obsessed with the Swift programming language.<br>
			I utilized Objective C and <i>some</i> C/C++, but the capabilities of Swift enabled me to take my passion for programming to the next level.

			An abundance of weird and nondeterministic events lead me where I am today and I truly could not be happier.<br>
			As the Earth continues to revolve, so will my desire to teach, grow, and learn.<br>
			I'm excited to find out what happens next!
