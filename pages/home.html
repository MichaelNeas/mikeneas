		<h4>After playing a variety of sports, meeting some of my best friends, and graduating, I shipped out to Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  
				The regimented lifestyle was different but I learned invaluable life lessons, sailed around South America, and played collegiate lacrosse.

		<h4>Fast-forward, I transferred back to my home state and studied at The University of Connecticut.</h4>

		<h4>
			Through persistence and hard work, I qualified for the Computer Science &amp; Engineering program.

		<div class="window-fly"></div>
		<h4>
			Fast forward countless trials and tribulations...
			My closest friends and I ended up winning UConn Senior design with an unfunded, muscle &amp; android controlled, 3D printed prosthetic arm, we named Hydra.
			I successfully graduated a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering.

		<h4>
			Shortly after graduating I moved down to North Carolina for a full time job writing web software.
			There I met some incredible people, explored the beautiful blue mountains, and the ever familiar East coast shoreline.

		<h4>
			Following North Carolina, I migrated up to New England to continue pursuing my passion for Software Engineering. 
			I was continually switching between Node.JS, Python, and PHP projects as needed.

		<h4>
			New oportunities induced and I found myself able to turn my IoT hobbies and interests into my primary focus!  
			Any given day I could be writing swift, objective C, or even some C++.

		<h4>
			I was presented with another fork in the road, chose the path less traveled and headed up to Boston.
			I now find myself working for a truly amazing tight knit agency, developing quality apps at expeditious velocities. ðŸš€

		<h4>
			An abundance of weird, nondeterministic, events occured for me to end up where I am today and I could not be happier.
			As the Earth continues to revolve, so will my desire to teach, grow, and learn.
			I can't wait to find out what happens next!
