		<h4>After playing tons of sports, meeting some best friends, and graduating, I shipped out to Massachusetts Maritime Academy.  
				The regimented lifestyle was different and I learned invaluable life lessons, sailed around South America, and played collegiate lacrosse.

			Countless trials and tribulations later,
			my closest friends and I ended up winning Senior design with an unfunded, muscle &amp; android controlled, 3D printed prosthetic arm, named Hydra.

			Then I moved down to North Carolina for a full time job writing internal tooling web software.
			I met some incredible people, explored the beautiful blue mountains, and the ever familiar East coast shoreline.

			An abundance of weird, nondeterministic, events occured for me to end up where I am today and I could not be happier.
			As the Earth continues to revolve, so will my desire to teach, grow, and learn.
			I can't wait to find out what happens next!
