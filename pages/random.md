### Life

It's important to maintain an understanding of the little control a single individual has in this world.  Sure in some countries money will allow power dynamics to shift in their favor.  But at the end of the day everyone experiences some flavor of risk with their decisions.  It's something applicable to all humans.  Along with that comes how one responds to situations that may arise from that risk.  Ones true power and strength can shine through during the toughest of times.  No matter how many times non-optimal situations occur in life, the ability to handle them in a positive manner is in control by those who experience the event.  

As cliche as it is, there will always be light at the end of the tunnel.  And thinking holistically should allow us to really understand how priveleged of a situation we're in.

Live life to the fullest, go without fear, bring willingness and positivity to every situation and let the sails take their course.

It's so easy to be negative about every little thing.  Some people are completely consumed at the notion of perpetual unhappiness.  It is important to be empathetic to those people but not let them bring down your emotional well being.  Surround yourself with people who make you a better human being.

Keeping that in mind, sometimes it's hard to restrain one's self from following the path of least resistance.  Through continuous reflection and meta thought anyone can overcome their outlook.

Thinking before speaking is so powerful and will allow a person to shine bright in any sea of darkness.  If there is a feeling of unhappiness or negativity, it might be beneficial to speak about that out loud to yourself or someone who can talk through it with you.  Instead of saying that negative thought, how about angling speach towards _why_ the negative thought exists in the first place.

Through constructive conversation humans can overcome incredible pitfalls of thought.

This process can be applied to most emotional reactions as well.  Instead of blowing up in anger over.. well anything, how about change the dialog to _why_ the anger exists in the first place.  It might be surprising what one finds by taking a second to think before acting.
