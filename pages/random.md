### Life

It's important to maintain an understanding of the little control a single individual has in this world.  Sure in some countries money will allow power dynamics to shift in their favor.  But at the end of the day everyone experiences some flavor of risk with their decisions.  It's something applicable to all humans.  Along with that comes how one responds to situations that may arise from that risk.  Ones true power and strength can shine through during the toughest of times.  No matter how many times non-optimal situations occur in life, the ability to handle them in a positive manner is in control by those who experience the event.  

As cliche as it is, there will always be light at the end of the tunnel.  And thinking holistically should allow us to really understand how priveleged of a situation we're in.

Live life to the fullest, go without fear, bring willingness and positivity to every situation and let the sails take their course.
