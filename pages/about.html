<h1>Who am i?</h1>

<div>
I grew up in a small town on the shoreline of Connecticut known as Old Saybrook.  After graduating and meeting some of the best friends of my life I went to Massachusetts Maritime Academy and ended up transferring back to CT to go to UConn.  A lot of weird nondeterministic events occured for me to end up where I am today, but I couldn't be happier.  Life is always busy, I know where home is and I look forward to every day.
