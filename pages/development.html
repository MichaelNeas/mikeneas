            Angular2 is a front end framework I've been able to work with since Beta.  When the production version rolled out I quickly lobbied for it for a project at Fidelity.  I made a sweet app that allowed all of the internal room build out employees to easily keep track of rooms and the devices inside them.  Previously this process was entirely done in spreadsheets and this angular app brought a seamless, unified solution to a fun problem.

            Fast forward to my next job at GE I am using angular 2 under the Ionic2 framework to make a cross platform app responsible for telling users when there is a system outtage within GE. 

            The component structure and tree relationship between components makes a super easy visual and modular understanding of all parts of a website.

            I was able to play around a bunch with android throughout college.  

            Softmore year my friend Joey and I made an app called "Odd Jobs", which was a cool idea to bring students the ability to request odd jobs they needed done from fellow students.  From help moving out of a dorm, to a study buddy, to website buildouts.  We got to play around with all the cool parts of Android studio that allowed us to understand how android apps are constructed.

            Fast forward to senior year, my senior design project came with an android app to allow users to set specific presets on their prosthetic arm and deal with all the initial configuration of a new user using Hydra.  We strived for a nice simple UI that would bring simplicity to the complex workings of a 3d printed prosthetic arm.

            Bootstrap is one of those technologies any sort of UI developer has come across at one time or another.  If I ever want a preconfigured, grid, simple UI that I can throw together really quickly in a prototype I know bootstrap will be there. People that are way more into UI Design work on bootstrap regularly and I totally trust a lot of their design decisions.  Plus you can see bootstrap on so many modern websites today.  

            Side note: I love that Bootstrap went full flexbox because flexbox is amazing.  I haven't had the chance to dabble in bs4 production edition but I quite enjoyed 2 and 3.

            Cobol was a beast of a language I don't entirely want to use again.  I used cobol and SAS to query a mainframe for manpower hours at General Electric.  I was able to work first hand with a developer who had been using cobol for more years than I was alive for.  He cleared up all my confusion behind crazy loops in Cobol.

            The first time I ever used Github I was so lost, but nowadays I would feel lost without it.  Any sort of project that requires working with others needs source control and git and github kill the game.  You can keep track of old versions to roll back to, maintain branches for feature requests, pull from upstream for automating build processes.  Thank you linus.

            HTML5 is actually crazy.  I did a project in canvas in a college design class and it blew my mind all that it has to offer.  HTML5 also includes local storage and much more.  When I first started making websites in 8th grade html was used for basic templating and I honestly didn't even think much more than that.  But with the semantic tags and all the crazy new features, HTML5 definitely qualifies for a cool technology I use on a daily basis.

        <div class="techinfo">
            Oh boy.  Java.  I learned java for the first time during an introductory CS class and it shortly became my language of choice for just about all my classes.  Not just because that's what my teachers required but it was crazy to use an IDE.  Intelisense is one of the coolest (and harmful) inventions ever.  I used eclipse for developing, sorry netbeans.  

            I think I've used java for more projects than I can count or even remember.  And it makes sense right?  Unlike JS you can pretty much gaurantee whats going on, provide strict typing, handle stream logic, inheritance is how humans (or at least me) tend to think about things.  The JVM is genious, portable code...like thats so useful, not even being sarcastic.  

            Sure Java can be bloated but for any beginner in programming it's really easy to get into.  Write one class javac, or push the green run button, get a java file and boom you get an output.  I've worked with JFrames too... and unfortunately JSP's...  Nowadays I wouldn't ever think of using Java for front end stuff but as a backend engine, sure why not?  Throw Spring in there and you can easily generate a RESTful service to interface with a database.
    
            Thanks for the good times java, I'll be back soon, I'm sure

            Javascript.. oh javascript.

            You won't see a good website out there that doesn't have JS behind it.  The things people have accomplished and problems solved are absolutely INSANE.  I remember when I first learned about Node...I loved me some php but there's something so attractive to me about a full javascript stack. 

            Front end get out of here.  People keep making js frameworks all to destroy so many different problems and I have to keep up with all that!  Some day I hope that I can be a pro at some framework I really like but for now I'll have to keep learning.

            I definitely didnt use and javascript to it's full potential until I started learning what functional programming was.  Now I'm obsessed with map, reduce, filters and that prototype.  Callbacks make you think about things a bit differently and I always have to make sure to break down all my functions to steps to solve a bigger problem.

            PS. I made this website with no frameworks or anything just to see if I still remember good old vanilla (not the VanillaJS) js and it was really fun.

            I first learned about JQuery in 11th grade and admittedly I stopped using regular js.  JQuery makes life rediculously easy when you need to manipulate the DOM.  There are so many plugins and concretely solved problems with JQuery.  I don't care what you say, JQuery will always have it's place in my heart.  I recently (in 2017) used JQuery to make a PoC that turned to a production app for keeping track of savings at GE [and no one noticed it was jQuery]...until they asked me of course.

            Google's Materialize fits in this page because I keep finding myself using it.  Angular uses a material design, the material design is a great standard for webapps.  There is all the capabilities of Bootstrap and more, sort of integrated to one place.  Plus I am a google fan boy and love mostly all their products.  A project I recently used materialize for was a Reddit app that queries any given subreddit to get the top posts for a give time period.  I just wanted to see if I could go about making a more user friendly experience for reddit because reddits awesome and some people get intiimidated by the giant wall of text.

            MySQL databases are the cats pajamas.  I used mysql for my entire employeement at UConn transportation.  SQL is incredibly human readable and thinking about a relational database just makes sense.  Mysql gives you web access to a database in an simple way.  I implemented a ton of feature requests for transpo and the fact that it was a mysql database helped me quickly get up to speed on 100's of tables and 10+ years of developer interactions with code and their database.

            PostgreSQL was used in the room tracker app talked about before in the angular icon.  But besides that I've taught my friend how a object relational database works using POSTgres for a fun little side project where we modeled the NHL.  He came in to the project with 0 programming experience and was able to understand relationships and data models like he went to school for cs instead of psych.

            Addressing the giant elephant in the page.  PHP is that ex-girlfriend I had so many great experiences with but time and location forcefully separated us.  PHP in it's prime was my server language of choice and I'm so happy I got to use it with over 8 different projects.  One noteable project was for my database class where we used the chinook database, created a login, and a nice ui.  We got to model what a customer who wanted to buy music from different employees would have to go through.  

            I have done some terrible terrible things with PHP but I know my mistakes and don't regret anything.  Who would have thought nesting html, css, and js in a php actually was a bad thing?  Anyway, its super supported since it's been around forever and I do hope I can use it for another project in my future to reunite one last time.

            Scripting in python is so freaking awesome.  Though I use python 2.7 for most things (I'll learn 3 sooner or later XP).  Python has libraries for seemingly everything and it's incredibly nice to use when interfacing with hardware.  It's sloppy but it gets the job done.  One project Dan and I got to do used scikit learn and Numpy and if you haven't used it before, go do it right now.  Just about anything you can think related to AI and math can be done with these libraries in like 5 lines of code.  

            Heck I use a python server when doing local development for this website. Try `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in your terminal if you havent, wicked useful.  I also have been known to write python scripts for grabbing authorization/authentication details from various apis because....THERE'S RESOURCES FOR THEM.

            Racket but more specifically Scheme was the first language I learned at UConn.  I learned about mutators, tail recurssion, functional paradigms, and even got to plot a mandelbrot function with Scheme and Racket supported all of it.  It was supposidly the weed out course for all people interested in CSE and it was certainly not an easy class but man was it worth it.  I wouldn't want to go back in time and erase any of those long nights I got to go through learning scheme, I would definitely do it again now after I've learned what I have over the years since that class.

            Relational databases are awesome.  Sure they may not be as fast as non-relational databases (most times), but when you use sql things just make sense.  And "good" normalization to reduce data redundency is way less difficult than it sounds.  I use a SQL database whenever I can, though POSTGres is slowly taking favor because its all open sourced and cool like that.  But without sql a ton of database constructs wouldn't even exist.

            I've been wrestling with a love hate relationship with TypeScript.  Typescript is not "BAD", during compile time, I love the type safety that TypeScript provides.  As a developer inside a monoliphic framework, TypeScript allows me to reason about input and outputs of functions and manipulating types like you can is just so damn cool.  My unlikingness of the language comes strictly from the transpile.  End of day your code gets transpiled to javascript and all the type gaurding and build up done definitely helps with writing better software but it's not really used when your transpiled js is what gets shown to the user anyways.  

            TypeScript also opened my eyes to VSCode and though I loved sublime text, vscode is my new bae for a text editor/ide.  It's so powerful and the intellisense and built in functionality for TypeScript makes it absolutely delightful to work with.

            I'm throwing Visual Basic into the mix because I always seem to be writing macros for finance people in their excel sheets.  It's a useful but annoying skill to have and I'm definitely rusty but macros make life so much easier if you live in excel.  I made a macro that lets you concatenate selected options into a comma separated list to appease the upload requirements for checkboxes in a form.  Before that I was able to use VBA to take a 4 hour process of copying and checking data in over 20 sheets into a 1 minute coffee break.
